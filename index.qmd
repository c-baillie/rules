## Why Rules may be unclear
- Different rules for **Run Charts** and **SPC Charts**

- Many different rule sets     

  - **3-Sigma Rule**: The original test devised by Shewhart as one test to identify special cause variation. The rule signals if one or more data points fall outside the 3-sigma limits. While effective in detecting larger shifts in data, minor of moderate shifts may go unnoticed. Therefore, many additional tests have been proposed to increase the sensitivity to non-random variation.
  - [Western Electric Rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Electric_rules) described in the Statistical Quality Control Handbook (Western Electric Company 1956). 
  - [Nelson Rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_rules) first published in the October 1984 issue of the Journal of Quality Technology in an article by Lloyd S Nelson.[@nelson_shewhart_1984]
  - Healthcare Rules recommended by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement
- Rules are not intuitive       
  - Most of the rules (other than rule 1) derived derived from Monte Carlo methods. 


## Rules for Determining a Special Cause
There is general agreement among users of Shewhart charts that a single point outside of either limit is an indication of a special cause of variation.

However there have been [many suggestions](https://www.qimacros.com/control-chart/stability-analysis-control-chart-rules/) for systems of rules to identify special causes that appear as nonrandom patterns within the limits. Provost[@provost_health_2011] uses ﬁve rules which are recommended for general use with Shewhart charts. These rules are consistent in the sense that the chance of occurrence of Rules 2 through 5 in a stable process is approximately equal to the chance of Rule 1 occurring in a stable process. The occurrence of any one of the rules is a clear indication of the presence of a special cause.

**Figure 4.5 summaries these five rules**

## Interpretation of Rules

While they work as a system, each rule is useful to identify different types of special causes. 

- Rule 1 quickly identiﬁes sudden changes in the measure.       

- Rule 2 identiﬁes small, sustained changes (like a small improvement to a process).      
- Rule 3 detects a small, consistent drift in a process (trend).     
- Rule 4 adds additional sensitivity to detect changes that have not yet triggered Rule 1 or Rule 2.       
- Rule 5 is especially useful in detecting a reduction of variation with an I chart, or for detecting improper subgrouping − with an X chart.          

For improvement activities, these ﬁve rules can be used to provide evidence of an improvement to a process or system. These rules also provide evidence of “losing” gains previously made in a system.
